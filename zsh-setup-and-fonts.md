## 📚 Using [Mono Fonts with Ligatures](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/monospaced-programming-fonts-with-ligatures) for Code

### **Fira Code:** [https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

The most widely adapted and probably the the font with the most ligature support.

![https://tjay.dev/content/images/2019/09/image-6.png](https://tjay.dev/content/images/2019/09/image-6.png)

### **Cascadia Code:** [https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)

Microsoft's shot at making a ligature font. What sets it apart from Fira is the ability to have an italics set and cursive italics (this option has to be enabled separately, see the README.) Has a version of it (`Cascadia (Code|Mono) PL`) that has Powerline symbols embedded into it if you want to use it in terminal environments. 


### ✨ **Some other fonts for your consideration:**

- **Anything from here (with comparisons)**: [https://betterwebtype.com/articles/2020/02/13/5-monospaced-fonts-with-cool-coding-ligatures/](https://betterwebtype.com/articles/2020/02/13/5-monospaced-fonts-with-cool-coding-ligatures/)
- **Victor Mono:** [https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)

### 🧑‍💻 Using ligature fonts in VS Code:

1. Download and add the font to Font Book.
2. Open the settings.json file and add :

```json
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
"editor.fontFamily": "'[your font name here]', 'consolas', monospace",

// for Cascadia Code: (See its github README for more details)
// "editor.fontFamily": "'Cascadia Code', 'consolas', monospace",
// "editor.fontLigatures": "'ss01', 'ss02', 'ss03', 'ss04', 'ss05', 'ss06', 'zero', 'onum'",
```

Your terminal should look something like this!

**If you're not interested in using Hyper, and you're done! You can stop here and enjoy your new config for `zsh` 👌**

### To use your new fonts in the `zsh` terminal within VScode:

1. Open the settings.json file for VS Code via the Command Palette : `Cmd+Shift+P`
    
    ![Untitled](Useful%20Tools%20and%20Extensions%208fcc1eb512a84e119d1e08c6aa3b32d0/Untitled%204.png)
    
2. Paste the following in this file and save.
    
    ```json
    // --------------------- TERMINAL ---------------------------
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "PowerlineSymbols, 'mononoki Nerd Font Mono', monospace",
    ```
    

<aside>
📌 Check out the [VSCode page on the integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) for more options.

Personally, I like to add this:

```json
"terminal.integrated.cursorStyle": "line", // valid: "block", "line", "underline"
"terminal.integrated.cursorBlinking": true,
"terminal.integrated.confirmOnExit": "hasChildProcesses",
```

## autocomplete

[zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete)
Clone the repo:

```
% cd ~/Repos  # ...or wherever you keep your Git repos/Zsh plugins
% git clone --depth 1 -- https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete.git
```

Add at or near the top of your .zshrc file (before any calls to compdef):

```
source ~/Repos/zsh-autocomplete/zsh-autocomplete.plugin.zsh
```

Remove any calls to compinit from your .zshrc file.
Restart your shell.


To update, do:
```
% git -C ~autocomplete pull
```
To uninstall, simply undo the installation steps above in reverse order:

Restore the lines you deleted in step 3.
Delete the line you added in step 2.
Delete the repo you created in step 1.
Restart your shell.



## ⚡️ Hyper
